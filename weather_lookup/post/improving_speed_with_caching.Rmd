## Summary

Here we demonstrate the use of the new `bindCache()` function in Shiny to greatly speedup a Shiny app that queries an NOAA weather station data API. The use of caching not only speeds up the app for end users but relieves pressure from the API. In this post we will demonstrate the adding of `bindCache` to existing reactive expressions, explaining where and why it should be used along with some potential gotchas of doing so. 

## Weather App

The code and results in this post come from the [weather lookup app.](connect.rstudioservices.com/explore_your_weather/) To gain an understanding of the app check out the [accompanying post](shiny.com/articles/weather_app_intro) introducing it.


## Performance

While this application we've built is interesting and potentially useful, it can be a bit slow. This is because the querying of the NOAA API is typically a slow process and may need to be repeated many times for cities with lots of stations. Along with the time the `city_data()` reactive takes, each one of the plots takes a non-negligible amount of time to render. All of this adds up to an interactive experience of less-than-light-speed. While using progress messages to alert the user to what's happening can help, ideally we could just make the app faster...


## Adding Caching

A convenient fact about our app is that it will always look the same when a given city is selected. The normals will always be the same because the same stations will always be queried etc.. This means we can use __caching__ to pull up the results for a city by simply remembering the output of our reactive the last time the city was seen. 

As of Shiny V1.6, adding caching to any reactive is as easy as piping the reactive to the function `bindCache()`. You tell `bindCache()` what the important input variable is that determines the output of the reactive and Shiny will automatically setup a cache store and most likely give you large speed improvements. 

This operates just like the function `renderCachedPlot()` that was introduced in Shiny v1.2, however now any reactive variable can be cached (in fact, `renderCachedPlot()` now uses `bindCache` under-the-hood.)

To take advantage of caching we will add it in three separate places in the app: our `r city_data` reactive, the temperature plot, and the precipitation plot. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('caching-added') %>% 
  flair("bindCache(input$city)") %>%
  flair("city_data", color = city_data_color) %>% 
  flair( "output$tempPlot", color = temp_color) %>% 
  flair("output$prcpPlot", color = prcp_color)
```

```{r caching-added, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  ...
  city_data <- reactive({...}) %>%
    # Our results will always be the same for a given city
    bindCache(input$city)

  output$tempPlot <- renderPlot({...}) %>%
    bindCache(input$city)
  
  output$prcpPlot <- renderPlot({...}) %>%
    bindCache(input$city)
  ...
}
```

## Performance with caching

So how much of a benefit do we get from adding those three `bindCache()` calls to our code? An easy way to see is to just run and compare before and after. There is absolutely a big impact, with the greatest impact seen with the "previous city" button. The act of retrieving and displaying the previous city is almost instant, compared to the non-cached app. 


<div class = "centered_img" style = "width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;"> 

<video width="100%" controls="controls" style = "margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
<source src="speed_comparison.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>


_Speed comparison of toggling back and forth between a cached and non-cached app. The cached app changes the city almost instantly with no loading needed._
</div>


We can be a bit more objective with this comparison by using `shinytest`. We can record a typical use of the app and then replay the usage on the app with and without caching. We can wrap this test in a function and use the `bench` package to compare the runtimes over multiple sessions. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
run_usage_test <- function(app_dir){
  app <- ShinyDriver$new(app_dir, seed = 42)
  # Using a seed because the app randomly chooses city in rnd_city button and
  # initial back button

  app$snapshotInit("mytest")
  app$setInputs(city = "Minneapolis, MN")
  app$setInputs(city = "Houston, TX")
  app$setInputs(prev_city = "click")
  app$setInputs(prev_city = "click")
  app$setInputs(prev_city = "click")
  app$setInputs(city = "New York, NY")
  app$setInputs(prev_city = "click")
  app$setInputs(prev_city = "click")
}

# Compare runtimes
bench::mark(run_usage_test("cached_app/"),
            run_usage_test("uncached_app/"),
            iterations = 15,
            check = FALSE)
```


<div class = "centered_img"> 
<img src="runtime_comparison.png" width = 90%/> 

_App runtimes of 15 separate sessions for both cached and non-cached versions of the weather app._
</div>


It's important to note that the most time-consuming aspect of these tests is actually starting the `shinytest` instance, so the difference in usable speed is rather drastic. 
  
## Setting cache scope

There are two main ways to scope the cache in your app using the `cache` argument in `bind_cache()`: `"app"` and `"session"`. The default is `"app"` which allows cached reactive to be shared between different sessions of the app. This means that in our app the startup city (and other common cities) will be much quicker to load as only the very first user pays the computation price. This behavior is most of the time what you want, but if you have potentially sensitive data being stored within your reactives the `session` option may be better. This gives each session of the app its own cache, so there's no danger of information leaking between users. 

A third and less common but still very useful option for scoping is disk scoping. This is accomplished by setting `bind_cache(..., cache = cachem::cache_disk())`. Disk caching will write the cache - as the name implies - to the disk. This allows the cache to persist beyond a single app, but - as disk is slower than memory - the speed of retrieval takes a hit. (A solution to this is to use a "[layered cache](https://github.com/r-lib/cachem/#layered-caches)," but that's beyond the scope of this article.)

## Setting cache size

One last knob you may want to tune when using `bindCache()` is the size of memory allocated to store results. The default amount is 200 MB, meaning that all calculated values for your reactive will be cached until the size exceeds 200 MB, then the key-value pairs that was least recently used is discarded until the total size is under 200 MB again. You can modify this placing `shinyOptions(cache = cachem::cache_mem(size = <new_size_in_bytes>))` in  `app.R`, `server.R`, or `global.R`. For a more through explanation of options for scoping (such as default behavior of session-scoped cache,) see the section "Cache scope" in the `bind_cache()` documentation (`?shiny::bind_cache`). 

## When to _not_ use caching

Caching in your shiny apps is one of the easiest and most dramatic ways of making performance increases, however, it can sometimes be overkill or even make your app slower. A good rule of thumb is to reach for caching when your reactive:

1. Takes a while to calculate
2. Will likely be needed again
3. The inputs (or cache-keys) are simple.

For instance, caching a reactive that does something like building a string from basic inputs will likely yield little to no improvement because the time spent hashing the inputs into a key and searching for the result in the cache may take longer than simply re-building the value. For a good example of this see the [`station_info` output in the weather lookup app.](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_showcase/blob/master/weather_lookup/app.R#L137-L145) As it just writes some simple HTML text caching is not needed.
