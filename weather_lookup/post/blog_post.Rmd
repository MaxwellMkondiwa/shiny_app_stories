## Summary

Here we demonstrate the use of the new `bindCache()` function in Shiny to greatly speedup a Shiny app that queries an NOAA weather station data API. The use of caching not only speeds up the app for end users but relieves pressure from the API. In this post we will demonstrate the adding of `bindCache` to existing reactive expressions, explaining where and why it should be used along with some potential gotchas of doing so. 

## Demo App

To demonstrate the benefits of caching we have built a shiny app that allows the user to look up the typical temperature range and precipitation amounts across a year. 

### NOAA Temperature Normals

The data driving the application comes from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA)](https://www.noaa.gov/). In the NOAA's open data portal they have a set of data for ["climate normals."](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/climate-normals) These data provide the "normal" or typical values of various climate measures for ~9.7 thousand weather stations around the US based on readings from 1981 to 2010. 

The way the data are stored place all the data for a given station within a text document located at an HTTP endpoint. For instance, the normals data for station <code><span style='color:forestgreen;'>USC00200228</span></code> located in Ann Arbor, MI is available at the endpoint 
[<code>https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/auxiliary/station/<span style='color:forestgreen;'>USC00200228</span>.normals.txt</code>](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/auxiliary/station/USC00200228.normals.txt)

There are lots of interesting measures available in these "normals" but what our app focuses on is the temperature (daily minimum, average, maximum) and precipitation (monthly totals). If you want more info on these data take a look at the [NOAA landing page](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/climate-normals/1981-2010-normals-data) or [the scientific manuscript accompanying them.](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/93/11/bams-d-11-00197.1.xml) 


### Inspiration for app

The goal for the app was to build a tool to quickly get a broad-level grasp of the weather in a given city. Questions such as "How hot does it get?" and "what's the wettest month?". An inspiration for the design came from the story ["How Much Warmer Was Your City in 2015?"](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/19/us/2015-year-in-weather-temperature-precipitation.html#new-york_ny) in the New York Times, by [K.K. Rebecca Lai.](https://www.nytimes.com/by/kk-rebecca-lai)

### App flow

#### `r city_data` 
The state of the app centers around the currently selected city. When a city is selected, the app then reaches out to the NOAA servers and `r flair_all("downloads the data for every station", color = data_color)` residing in that city. From this data the `r flair_all("temperature", color = temp_color)` and `r flair_all("precipitation", color = prcp_color)` normals are extracted and averaged together to give an "averaged average" portrait of the city's weather. This parsed data is then stored in `reactive` value called `r city_data`...

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('hefty-reactive') %>% 
  flair("city_data", color = city_data_color) %>% 
  flair("mutate(url = build_station_url(station),
               data = map(url, possibly(readr::read_file)))", color = data_color) %>% 
  flair("stations$temp_res <- map(stations$data, possibly(get_temp_data))", color = temp_color) %>% 
  flair("stations$prcp_res <- map(stations$data, possibly(get_prcp_data))", color = prcp_color)
```

```{r hefty-reactive, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  ...
  city_data <- reactive({
    ...
    withProgress(message = 'Fetching data from NOAA', {
      stations <- filter(station_to_city, city == input$city)
      
      ...
      # Not every station has both temperature and precipitation data. To deal
      # with this, loop through all stations in a city try to extract whatever
      # data is present. If a city has a lot of stations, like Fairbanks, AK,
      # this this can take a while
      incProgress(1/4, detail = "Downloading data from all found stations")
      stations <- stations %>%
        mutate(url = build_station_url(station),
               data = map(url, possibly(readr::read_file)))
      # purrr::possibly allows bad requests to fail without crashing app 
      
      ...
      incProgress(2/4, detail = "Extracting temperature data")
      stations$temp_res <- map(stations$data, possibly(get_temp_data))
      temperature <- collapse_stations(stations$temp_res)

      ...
      incProgress(3/4, detail = "Extracting precipitation data")
      stations$prcp_res <- map(stations$data, possibly(get_prcp_data))
      precipitation <- collapse_stations(stations$prcp_res)

      ...
  })})
    
  ...
}
```

This is a computationally intensive reactive value that does a lot of work. 

#### Plots

Two plots are generated using the data stored in `r city_data`. The first showing temperature and the second showing precipitation. These plots are themselves complex `ggplot2` objects, with many layers and annotations. Full ggplot code to generate each plot is available on github: [temperature,](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_showcase/blob/master/weather_lookup/app.R#L149-L204) [precipitation](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_showcase/blob/master/weather_lookup/app.R#L207-L252).

#### Previous city button

A lot of times one may be interested in comparing the weather between two cities. This is made easier in the app by having a previous city button. This button simply sets the city to the city viewed just before the current city. This enables quick toggling back and forth between two cities to see the differences.

## Performance

While this application we've built is interesting and potentially useful, it can be a bit slow. This is because the querying of the NOAA API is typically a slow process and may need to be repeated many times for cities with lots of stations. Along with the time the `city_data()` reactive takes, each one of the plots takes a non-negligible amount of time to render. All of this adds up to an interactive experience of less-than-light-speed. While using progress messages to alert the user to what's happening can help, ideally we could just make the app faster...


## Adding Caching

A convenient fact about our app is that it will always look the same when a given city is selected. The normals will always be the same because the same stations will always be queried etc.. This means we can use __caching__ to pull up the results for a city by simply remembering the output of our reactive the last time the city was seen. 

As of Shiny V1.6, adding caching to any reactive is as easy as piping the reactive to the function `bindCache()`. You tell `bindCache()` what the important input variable is that determines the output of the reactive and Shiny will automatically setup a cache store and most likely give you large speed improvements. 

This operates just like the function `renderCachedPlot()` that was introduced in Shiny v1.2, however now any reactive variable can be cached (in fact, `renderCachedPlot()` now uses `bindCache` under-the-hood.)

To take advantage of caching we will add it in three separate places in the app: our `r city_data` reactive, the temperature plot, and the precipitation plot. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
decorate('caching-added') %>% 
  flair("bindCache(input$city)") %>%
  flair("city_data", color = city_data_color) %>% 
  flair( "output$tempPlot", color = temp_color) %>% 
  flair("output$prcpPlot", color = prcp_color)
```

```{r caching-added, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  ...
  city_data <- reactive({...}) %>%
    # Our results will always be the same for a given city
    bindCache(input$city)

  output$tempPlot <- renderPlot({...}) %>%
    bindCache(input$city)
  
  output$prcpPlot <- renderPlot({...}) %>%
    bindCache(input$city)
  ...
}
```

## Performance with caching
- Biggest difference seen when toggling back and forth
  
## Tuning Caching
- Disk cache
- App cache
  - Will speed up app for future user's too
  - Common cities will be almost instant
- Cache size

## `bindCache()` vs `renderCachedPlot()`
- They're the same
